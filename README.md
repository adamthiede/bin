# bin

my `~/.local/bin`

## `g`, `cg`, `c`, `rs`

Code runners. Distrobox is top tier. I usually don't put compilers on my host OS and put them in containers instead. Don't need a bunch of -dev packages and stuff on my actual host OS. Increases attack surface and all that, plus if I get into a weird dependency situation I can nuke the container and start over.

## all the other stuff

I'm split between bash functions and scripts. Most of this stuff could probably be in .bashrc but I try to keep that clean.

Some of this stuff was found elsewhere/cargo-culted in. No harm intended by putting it here. If it's yours and you don't want it here email me.
